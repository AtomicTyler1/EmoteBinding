## About the mod

This mod lets you set a keybind to an emote via a config.

> Note: It is recommend you use [ModConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/PEAKModding/ModConfig) to edit the keybinds directly in game!

This mod also has full support for custom emotes! However, **custom emotes are set to no keybind on default**.

## How to config base game emotes

Bweefore you would need to open the emote wheel once, that bug has since been fixed, although you may still need to go into the airport once for any new emotes.
Navigate to your BepInEx folder, then Bepinex/config, and open `com.atomic.emotebinding.cfg` in notepad or what's preferred. Refer to the part below for more steps.

Any custom emote: None (Unbound)

## How do I change the keybind?

Option 1: [ModConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/PEAKModding/ModConfig)
1. Launch the game
2. Navigate to the settings page (Works mid-game!)
3. Top-left, mod settings button
4. Find EmoteBinding
5. Change the emote button!

Option 2: Straight in the mod manager
1. Navigate the config section of the mod-manager
2. Find EmoteBinding (**YOU MUST BOOT UP THE GAME ONCE WITH THE MOD TO GENERATE THE CONFIG**)
3. Change the emote button!

Option 3: Manually
1. Navigate to your BepInEx folder
2. Bepinex/config
3. Open `com.atomic.emotebinding.cfg` in notepad or what's preferred
4. Change the emote button!

(Note option 3 is not as good as option 1 and 2, it is always recommended you use a mod manager before asking for support).
