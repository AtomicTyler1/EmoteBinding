## About the mod

This mod lets you set a keybind to an emote via a config.

> Note: It is recommend you use [ModConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/PEAKModding/ModConfig) to edit the keybinds directly in game!

This mod also has full support for custom emotes! However, **custom emotes are set to no keybind on default**.

## How to config base game emotes

First start by launching the game with the mod installed, going to the Airport and then pressing R.
This will generate a config with the latest base game emotes.

Then, navigate to your BepInEx folder, then Bepinex/config, and open `com.atomic.emotebinding.cfg` in notepad or what's preferred. Refer to the part below for more steps.

Any custom emote: None (Unbound)

## How do I change the keybind?

Option 1: [ModConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/PEAKModding/ModConfig)
1. Launch the game
2. Navigate to the settings page (Works mid-game!)
3. Top-left, mod settings button
4. Find EmoteBinding
5. Change the emote button!

Option 2: Straight in the mod manager
1. Navigate the config section of the mod-manager
2. Find EmoteBinding (**YOU MUST BOOT UP THE GAME ONCE WITH THE MOD TO GENERATE THE CONFIG**)
3. Change the emote button!

Option 3: Manually
1. Navigate to your BepInEx folder
2. Bepinex/config
3. Open `com.atomic.emotebinding.cfg` in notepad or what's preferred
4. Change the emote button!

(Note option 3 is not as good as option 1 and 2).
